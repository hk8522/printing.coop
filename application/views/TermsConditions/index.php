            <div class="universal-dark-info">
                <span>Inkjet and laser prints are known to look substantially different than offset printing. We offer quick turnaround and low prices by printing to a "pleasing color" standard, using standard ink densities. There is no guarantee that your finished piece will match your printer output. This is due to the varying results from different output devices including inkjet printers, continuous tone proofing devices, and film-based proofs.<br> No refunds or credits will be given for a printed order which does not match your inkjet proof.<br><br> ENVELOPES AND LETTERHEADS PAPER EFFECT IN COLOR.<br> Please note that because our letterhead and envelope paper stock is "uncoated", we recommend you not use colors with high color density. By this we mean dark colors (black, purple, blue, brown, etc). Dark colors tend to get soaked into the paper if their color values are too high. For best results, use light colors.</span>
